localization
============

Repo for collaborative creation of localized documentation.

Each language will have it's own top level directory, with sub directories for each library, version, and resource type. For example /ja/SoundJS/0.4.0/src or  /fr/EaselJS/0.6.0/tutorials.

Language owners are responsible for building new API docs from the translated source comments. See the "tools" directory in each library's repo for build tools and info.

Add an issue if you'd like to translate documentation or other materials to a new language. Submit a pull request to contribute to an existing translation request.
